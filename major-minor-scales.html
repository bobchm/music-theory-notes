            A major scale is a seven-note musical scale with a specific pattern
            of tones and semitones: T T S T T T S. It forms the basis of most
            Western music and has a bright, happy sound. The scale's structure
            is defined by this pattern, not the specific notes, allowing it to
            be built from any starting note to create different major scales.
            For example, here is the C major scale:

            Minor scales are diatonic scales that have a minor third above the
            tonic, often creating a sad or melancholic sound. There are three
            main types: the <b>natural minor</b>, <b>harmonic minor</b>, and
            <b>melodic minor</b>. Each type is a variation of the same key
            signature, distinguished primarily by changes to the sixth and
            seventh scale degrees.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
            The <b>natural minor scale</b> has the pattern T S T T S T T (a
            rotated form of its relative major).
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
            The <b>harmonic minor scale</b> has the pattern has the same notes
            as the minor except that the seventh degree is raised by one
            semitone, creating an augmented second between the sixth and seventh
            degrees: T S T T S T+S S.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
            The <b>melodic minor scale</b> has two different forms: an ascending
            form and a descending form. It was created as a reaction to the
            harmonic minor scale by those who thought the T+S jump was too big
            for their purposes. The ascending form (aka jazz minor scale) raises
            the sixth by a semitone while the descending form is identical to
            the natural minor scale.
