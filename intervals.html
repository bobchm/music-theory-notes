        <h1>Intervals</h1>
        <p class="body-text">
            Intervals are identified by labels that consist of two determinants,
            <b>quality</b> and <b>number</b>. You can calculate the number of an
            interval by regarding the lower note as the tonic and then counting
            up the degrees of the scale. Note that the two notes in the interval
            can be sounded together as a <b>harmonic interval</b>, or in
            succession as a <b>melodic interval</b>.

            Qualities that go with the number include: Perfect, Major, Minor,
            Augmented, and Diminished. Perfect intervals are the unisons,
            fourths, fifths, and octaves, known for stability. Major and minor
            intervals apply to seconds, thirds, sixths, and sevenths, with major
            being wider and minor being narrower by a half step. Augmented
            intervals are a half step larger than their perfect or major
            counterparts, while Diminished intervals are a half step smaller
            than their perfect or minor counterparts. From a semitone
            perspective:
