        <p class="body-text">
            Major, minor, augmented, and diminished chords are all three-note
            triads with different qualities based on the intervals between their
            root, third, and fifth notes.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A major chord has a major third (4 semitones) and a perfect
                fifth (3 semitones) – Example: C major (C-E-G)
            </li>
            <li>
                A minor chord has a minor third (3 semitones) and a perfect
                fifth (4 semitones) – Example: C minor (C-Eb-G)
            </li>
            <li>
                An augmented chord is a major chord with a raised (augmented)
                fifth resulting in two stacked major thirds (4 semitones + 4
                semitones). It's a major chord with a raised fifth. Example:
                C-E-G#
            </li>
            <li>
                A diminished chord is a minor chord with a lowered (diminished)
                fifth resulting in two stacked minor thirds (3 semitones + 3
                semitones). It's a minor chord with a lowered fifth. Example:
                C-Eb-Gb
            </li>
        </ul>
