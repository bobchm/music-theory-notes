        <h1>The Circle of Fifths</h1>
        <h4 class="cp-label">The Perfect Fifth</h4>
        <p class="body-text">
            From a starting point of C major (no sharps or flats), the pattern
            for major scales with sharp key signatures is G, D, A and E, with
            the key signature for each scale adding an additional sharp to the
            previous one.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
            The pattern for major scales with flat key signatures is F, B♭, E♭
            and A♭, with the key signature for each scale adding an additional
            flat to the previous one.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
            Each successive major scale with a sharp key signature starts on the
            note a perfect fifth above the previous one, and each successive
            scale with a flat key signature starts on the note a perfect fifth
            below the previous one. So G major, with one sharp in its key
            signature, begins on the note a perfect fifth above C, which has no
            sharps or flats in its key signature. And D major, with two sharps
            in its key signature, begins on the note a perfect fifth above G.
            And so on.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
            Conversely, F major, with one flat in its key signature, begins on
            the note a perfect fifth below C, and B♭ major, with two flats in
            its key signature, begins on the note a perfect fifth below F. And
            so on.
        </p>
        <h4 class="cp-label">The Circle of Fifths</h4>
        <p class="body-text">
            This sequence of keys, extended to cover a whole series, is better
            understood as a diagram, the circle of fifths. The major keys sit
            outside the circle and their corresponding relative minors (which
            have the same key signature) inside the circle.

        <h4>The Minor Third</h4>
        <p class="body-text">
            The tonic of a relative minor scale can be found by counting down
            three semitones from the tonic of its major equivalent, for
            instance, the tonic of C major down to the tonic of A minor. This
            interval, A–C, consisting of three semitones, we can now name as a
            <b>minor third</b>.
