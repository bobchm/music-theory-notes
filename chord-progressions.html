        <h1>Popular Chord Progressions</h1>
        <p class="body-text">
            Chord progressions are expressed in terms of their position in a
            given key, making it easy to change progressions to new keys, for
            example a very popular chord progression in current pop music is
            expressed as I-V-vi-IV. In the key of C, this means C-G-Am-F.

        <h4>I—V—vi—IV</h4>
        <p>
            The I-V-vi-IV is one of the most ubiquitous pop chord progressions
            in music today. Maybe that’s because it creates a great balance
            between tension and resolution. Starting on the stable I chord
            establishes the tonal center, while the following chords introduce
            anticipation, eventually moving back to the tonic. In the key of C
            major, this progression would be C (I), G (V), Am (vi), and F (IV).

        <h4>vi-IV-I—V</h4>
        <p>
            This is a minor variation of the above progression which starts on
            the vi chord and gives it a more somber feel. The shift from the
            minor chord towards the major chords creates a particularly
            emotional sonic journey which is why it has been used in so many
            powerful tracks. In the key of C major, this progression would be Am
            (vi), F (IV), C (I), and G (V).

        <h4>I-vi-IV-V</h4>
        <p>
            This version of the four-chord progression, also called the
            <a

                >50s Progression</a
            >, creates a more uplifting cycle than the vi—IV—I—V. In the key of
            C major, this progression would be C (I), Am (vi), F (IV), and G
            (V). This is a great choice for feel-good, melodic tracks.

            The I—vi—IV—V can be heard in Taylor Swift’s “ME!” ft. Brendon Urie:

        <h4>IV-V-I-vi</h4>
        <p>
            While this variation is still a popular chord progression, it is
            probably the least used of the four permutations we’ve discussed.
            This sequence starts on the IV and ends on the vi, which gives it a
            cyclical feeling as it doesn’t truly resolve. This makes it stand
            out.
