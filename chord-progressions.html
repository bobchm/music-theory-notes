        <h1>Popular Chord Progressions</h1>
        <p class="body-text">
            Chord progressions are expressed in terms of their position in a
            given key, making it easy to change progressions to new keys, for
            example a very popular chord progression in current pop music is
            expressed as I-V-vi-IV. In the key of C, this means C-G-Am-F.

        <h4>I—V—vi—IV</h4>
        <p>
            The I-V-vi-IV is one of the most ubiquitous pop chord progressions
            in music today. Maybe that’s because it creates a great balance
            between tension and resolution. Starting on the stable I chord
            establishes the tonal center, while the following chords introduce
            anticipation, eventually moving back to the tonic. In the key of C
            major, this progression would be C (I), G (V), Am (vi), and F (IV).

        <h4>vi-IV-I—V</h4>
        <p>
            This is a minor variation of the above progression which starts on
            the vi chord and gives it a more somber feel. The shift from the
            minor chord towards the major chords creates a particularly
            emotional sonic journey which is why it has been used in so many
            powerful tracks. In the key of C major, this progression would be Am
            (vi), F (IV), C (I), and G (V).

        <h4>I-vi-IV-V</h4>
        <p>
            This version of the four-chord progression, also called the
            <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%2750s_progression"

                rel="noopener"
                >50s Progression</a
            >, creates a more uplifting cycle than the vi—IV—I—V. In the key of
            C major, this progression would be C (I), Am (vi), F (IV), and G
            (V). This is a great choice for feel-good, melodic tracks.

            The I—vi—IV—V can be heard in Taylor Swift’s

        </p>
        <h4>IV-V-I-vi</h4>
        <p>
            While this variation is still a popular chord progression, it is
            probably the least used of the four permutations we’ve discussed.
            This sequence starts on the IV and ends on the vi, which gives it a
            cyclical feeling as it doesn’t truly resolve. This makes it stand
            out.

        <h4>ii-V-I</h4>
        <p>
            The ii—V—I (we say “two, five, one”) is a staple of jazz music. In
            the key of C major, the progression would be Dm (ii), G (V), and C
            (I). The ii chord acts as a stepping stone between the tonic (I) and
            dominant (V), and gives us a uniquely jazzy tonality. To add even
            more of a jazzy feel, consider adding chord extensions like sevenths
            or ninths.

            While it’s often heard in jazz, Maroon 5 used it in a pop context in
            their classic

        </p>
        <h4>i-VII-VI-V</h4>
        <p>
            This chord progression creates a strong descending bassline that
            lands on a tense dominant chord. In the key of A minor (the
            ‘relative minor’ of C major, which uses the same chords), this
            progression would be Am (i), G (VII), F (VI), and E (V). Notice that
            the E is a major chord. This is to emphasize the strength of the
            dominant chord and create tension that needs to be resolved by
            returning to the i chord.

        <h4>I-IV-V</h4>
        <p>
            One of the simplest, most effective, and most common chord
            progressions around is the I—IV—V. It was initially the foundation
            of rock, blues, and country songs, but over time has made its way
            into pop as well. In the key of C major, this would be C (I), F
            (IV), and G (V). This progression creates a strong sense of forward
            momentum.

            Charli XCX used a subtle arpeggiated version of the I—IV—V on
            <a href="https://youtu.be/f-NS9hnmWN4">detonate</a>
        </p>
        <h4>I-III-IV-iv</h4>
        <p>
            This progression uses a technique called ‘modal interchange’ with
            major and minor chords to create a surprising tonal shift. That
            shift occurs on the IV chord which changes its third degree from
            major to minor. In the key of C major, this would be C (I), E (III),
            F (IV), and F minor (iv). The III chord is also major, which is
            unusual in the context of a major key.

            Perhaps the most famous use of this popular chord progression is
            Radiohead’s <a href="https://youtu.be/XFkzRNyygfk">Creep</a>
        </p>
        <h4>i-VII-VI-VII</h4>
        <p>
            This is another popular progression in minor keys. In the key of A
            minor, it would be Am (i), G (VII), F (VI), and G (VII). This
            progression creates a sense of emotional power and intensity, with
            the VI and VII chords building up to the resolution on the minor
            tonic chord.

        <h4>Twelve Bar Blues</h4>
        <p>
            This chord progression only has three chords: I, VI, and V. It is
            its structure, however, that gives it its signature sound which has
            made its way onto many blues and rock recordings.
        </p>
        <p>The progression uses the chords in this order:</p>
        <p>I-I-I-I</p>
        <p>IV-IV-I-I</p>
        <p>V-IV-I-I</p>

            While you could easily find blues or rock recordings with this
            progression, Prince & The Revolution used it in a light pop style on

        </p>
        <h4>vi ii V I</h4>
        <p>
            A more complex form of the ii V I would be the vi ii V I (or 6 2 5
            1) progression, which is also known as the circle progression (based
            on the circle of fifths). It was made popular with George Gershwin’s
            <a href="https://youtu.be/oQdeTbUDCiw">I Got Rhythm</a> in 1931 and
            it worked just as well 70 years later in Weezer’s 2001 hit,

        <h4>Pachebel’s Progression: I V vi iii IV I IV V</h4>
        <p>
            And then there is Pachelbel’s Progression, which is I V vi iii IV I
            IV V (or 1 5 6 2 4 1 4 5). While this seems like a super long and
            specific progression, it has been all over pop music ever since
            Johann Pachelbel composed
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Af372EQLck">Canon</a> in D
            at the turn of the eighteenth century. This is one of the cases
            where not only the progression, but even the melody has been copied.
            You can hear the melody in Maroon 5’s
            <a href="https://youtu.be/SlPhMPnQ58k">Memories</a> and also in
            Blues Traveller’s <a href="https://youtu.be/pdz5kCaCRFM">Hook</a> (a
            song that pokes fun of over-formulaic pop songs).
